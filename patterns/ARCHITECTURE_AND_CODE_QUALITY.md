# Architecture And Code Quality

Use this pattern when building, reviewing, or refactoring application code. It
sets the reusable baseline for architecture, maintainability, and code quality
across stacks.

## Core Rule

- Build applications with clear architecture and code-quality boundaries.
- Understand and apply OOP, SOLID, DRY, clean-code, maintainability,
  extensibility, and established design and architecture-pattern principles
  where they fit the stack, including GoF, GRASP, clean architecture,
  microservices, DDD, and equivalent stack-appropriate patterns.
- Prefer cohesive domain models, explicit interfaces at integration boundaries,
  dependency inversion for infrastructure, small composable modules, typed or
  validated contracts, low duplication, clear names, focused functions/classes,
  and established framework patterns.
- Keep domain/product logic, orchestration, UI, persistence, filesystem,
  external services, and configuration in separate layers with explicit
  contracts.
- In non-OOP stacks, apply the same separation of responsibilities through
  modules, functions, services, protocols, and data contracts.
- Apply DRY to repeated knowledge and behavior, but do not create premature
  abstractions before the duplication has a clear shared meaning.

## Work Type Boundaries

- Treat refactoring as changing structure, names, module boundaries, dependency
  direction, duplication, or internal implementation while preserving
  user-visible behavior and documented API, storage, workflow, and UI
  contracts.
- Treat development as adding or changing behavior: new features, new runtime
  flows, new validation or error behavior, observability, integrations,
  background work, persistence shape changes, or tests that define a new
  contract.
- Treat verification and operations as separate work from both refactoring and
  development. Endpoint discovery, manager or service lifecycle actions,
  smoke-task creation, deploys, restarts, and release checks may support a
  refactor, but they are not themselves code refactors.
- For mixed work, name the refactor, development, verification, and operational
  parts explicitly before editing. Use the stricter rules for any part that
  changes behavior, public contracts, data, secrets, production systems, or
  external services.

## Architecture Boundaries

- Keep domain or product behavior independent from UI widgets, HTTP handlers,
  CLI parsing, filesystem paths, database clients, network clients, and
  provider-specific SDK calls.
- Put infrastructure behind adapters, repositories, gateways, clients, ports,
  interfaces, protocols, or equivalent framework-native boundaries.
- Keep orchestration focused on workflow coordination. Do not let it absorb
  domain rules, persistence details, UI rendering, or external API payload
  construction.
- Keep configuration loading and validation at startup or I/O boundaries. Pass
  validated settings inward through explicit objects or dependency injection.
- Prefer established architecture patterns that fit the stack, such as layered
  architecture, hexagonal/ports-and-adapters, clean architecture,
  domain-driven design, microservices, feature modules, MVC/MVVM, repository
  adapters, command handlers, and explicit service contracts.
- Use GoF, GRASP, and similar design patterns by intent, not by name-dropping:
  identify the force they solve, such as object creation, dependency direction,
  variation, orchestration, state, or responsibility assignment, then choose the
  simplest pattern that preserves clarity.
- Preserve user-visible behavior during refactors unless the user explicitly
  changes the agreement.

## Abstraction Guidance

- Add an abstraction when it removes real duplication, protects a meaningful
  boundary, enables interchangeable infrastructure, or matches an established
  local pattern.
- Avoid abstractions that only rename one implementation, hide simple code,
  encode speculative futures, or make the current behavior harder to verify.
- Keep interfaces small and purpose-driven. Prefer contracts that describe what
  the caller needs, not every method the implementation happens to expose.
- Keep shared helpers about shared meaning, not merely shared syntax.
- When duplication is not yet stable, keep the code clear and local, then
  revisit after a second or third concrete use reveals the real common shape.

## Contract-First Module Boundaries

- When extracting, splitting, or replacing a module, name the public contract
  before relying on the new boundary: caller, callee, input shape, output shape,
  error and empty-state behavior, side-effect ownership, and invariants that
  must not leak across layers.
- Keep contracts visible through names, typed interfaces, validated schemas,
  focused docstrings, tests, or project-memory specs as appropriate for the
  stack and risk.
- Test important boundaries through public module, service, API, CLI, or UI
  entry points instead of private helper internals.
- Do not let API/request handlers know persistence details, persistence know UI
  labels or rendering behavior, parsers know storage writes, UI renderers
  recreate backend aggregation rules, or adapters inspect or mutate data beyond
  their documented boundary.

## Review Checklist

Before finishing architecture-sensitive work, check the changed area for:

- unclear module, class, or function responsibilities;
- oversized functions/classes that mix unrelated concerns;
- domain or business rules duplicated across UI, API, persistence, or
  orchestration layers;
- direct infrastructure dependencies where an interface, adapter, or provider
  boundary is expected;
- hard-coded runtime, environment, product, user, prompt, query, or service
  values that belong in configuration, resources, task data, or adapters;
- UI/request handlers that contain persistence, provider, filesystem, or
  ranking logic;
- tests that only verify implementation details instead of the behavior or
  boundary contract;
- refactor plans that silently include feature work, contract changes,
  integration changes, runtime operations, or data migrations without naming
  those as development or operational work;
- new abstractions that add ceremony without reducing duplication or protecting
  an important boundary.
- design-pattern usage that obscures simple behavior, duplicates framework
  conventions, or exists only because a pattern could be applied.

## Verification

- Run the project's relevant tests, type checks, lint/format checks, or smoke
  checks for the changed area.
- Add or update focused tests when moving behavior behind a contract, adapter,
  service, repository, or module boundary.
- Verify at least one behavior-level path through the public API, UI workflow,
  CLI command, or service operation affected by the change.
- Confirm any new abstraction has more than speculative value: it should reduce
  meaningful duplication, simplify callers, or isolate a real integration
  boundary.
- Update project memory or architecture notes after meaningful feature,
  workflow, business-rule, data-model, integration, or architecture changes.
