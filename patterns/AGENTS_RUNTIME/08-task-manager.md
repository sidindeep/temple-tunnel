## Task Manager Commands

- Treat `gi manager`, `gi tm`, `gi manager test`, `ги менеджер`,
  `ги манагер`, and equivalent task-manager status or test wording as requests
  to inspect the configured task manager through config-service. Read the
  enabled manager id or `service_id` from project-local task-manager config,
  resolve it through `GET /services/{serviceId}`, read `endpoints.guide` when
  present, read `endpoints.contract`, then use `endpoints.api` for documented
  manager operations. Stop with the exact blocker if the manager id is missing,
  config-service is unavailable, no matching service record exists, or the
  guide/contract lacks the requested capability. Do not fall back to `base_url`,
  stale task-manager memory, port scans, sibling projects, or guessed endpoints.
- Treat `gi active task`, `gi next task`, `gi get task`, and equivalent
  active-task wording as requests to get executable work from the configured
  task manager. Resolve the manager through config-service, read the manager
  contract, request the active or next task through the documented operation,
  update manager lifecycle state and notes, and stop with the exact blocker if
  the contract, auth, permissions, lifecycle IDs, or requested object type is
  missing or mismatched. Do not create raw intake receipts, local checklist
  notes, or a different manager object type as a substitute for the requested
  task, sprint, or cycle.
- Treat task-manager sync commands as routine execution steps, similar in
  certainty to `gi commit`, `gi push`, or FTP deploy commands after the user has
  supplied the content or selected workflow. A fast or weaker model may execute
  these commands, but it must still follow the manager contract exactly: do not
  replace manager API work with `project-memory`, pending-task notes, guessed
  commands, raw intake receipts, local checklists, or "tell me the exact
  command" fallback. If discovery, auth, contract, capability, payload shape, or
  readback is missing, stop with the exact blocker.
- Treat `gi add sprint`, `gi create sprint`, `gi добавить спринт`, and
  equivalent add-sprint wording as requests to create a visible executable
  Sprint/Cycle through the configured task manager. Resolve the manager through
  config-service, read the manager contract, use only the documented sprint or
  cycle creation operation, verify readback/lifecycle identifiers, and stop with
  the exact blocker if auth, permissions, schema, lifecycle, or object type
  support is missing. Do not downgrade the request to raw intake or a Work Item.
