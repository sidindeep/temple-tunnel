## Scope And Startup Behavior

- Treat short greetings, thanks, acknowledgements, and status-neutral messages
  as no-ops unless they include an explicit task, path, command, error, or
  project question. Do not run startup restore or read project files for those
  messages; reply briefly and ask what the user wants to do next.
- On the first concrete task in a new chat/session, before task-specific
  startup restore, planning, implementation, or command execution, perform a
  quiet GI instruction update check. Use the current project's
  `tools/project-memory/instruction-kit.json` when present, resolve the accepted
  shared-instruction source, and read only `VERSION.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `INDEX.md`, and pending files under `migrations/`. Apply pending accepted
  migrations before continuing with task-specific work. In instruction-kit
  metadata, `update_check.enabled: true` authorizes both checking and applying;
  a missing `auto_apply_pending_migrations` field defaults to `true` for
  backward compatibility. Finding a newer version is not a completed startup
  check: do not merely report it or tell the user to run a later update command.
  Skip application only when metadata explicitly sets the update check or
  automatic application to `false`, or when a concrete source-access,
  filesystem, repository-scope, safety, or merge-conflict blocker exists.
  Name the blocker and continue with current local instructions unless the user
  explicitly requested `gi обновить`. Do not read `updates/`, old chat examples,
  broad project files, or unrelated source repositories for this startup check.
  Keep the user-facing output to one compact status line or include it in the
  first substantive reply. That compact status must explicitly include the
  pending migration count, including `0` when no migrations are pending.
- Before implementation, derive the task goal and observable success criteria
  from the user's request and relevant project context. A clear bounded fix,
  review, or instruction edit is sufficient without a project-goal interview.
  - Do not require the user to confirm a restatement of an already clear goal.
  - Ask focused questions only when missing information materially changes the
    result or scope; continue independent authorized work while waiting.
  - For a genuinely undefined product, clarify the target user, expected outcome,
    and success criteria before dependent implementation decisions.
- Track the agreed goal during the thread.
  - Reference it in first planning reply and after major changes.
  - In final output, report completion status against each goal criterion and
    list any remaining gap as a clear blocker.
- For `gi start`, `gi restore`, and title-only first messages, restore only the
  minimum orientation needed for the next turn: local instructions, the latest
  handoff summary, and compact git state. The latest handoff summary is the
  primary continuation artifact for a new chat: read it enough to recover the
  current topic, key theses or decisions, blockers, and next useful direction.
  Do not treat seeing only its filename, timestamp, or metadata as successful
  restore. Keep the response compact and do not read unrelated full runbooks,
  memory notes, logs, diffs, or older summaries unless a concrete task needs
  them.
- Treat `gi start sprint`, `gi sprint start`, and equivalent active-sprint
  wording as more specific than plain `gi start`: route them through the
  configured task-manager workflow, not generic startup restore.
- Treat `gi local sprint`, `gi sprint local`, `gi локальный спринт`,
  `gi спринт локально`, and equivalent explicitly local sprint wording as a
  local execution workflow, not as a request to resolve or mutate task-manager
  state. Read the routed sprint/task-manager module before acting, then use
  only the supplied chat context or project-local checklist location documented
  by local instructions.
- Do not treat remembered plans, old refactoring phases, stale task notes, or
  local commits ahead of a remote as the next action during `gi start` or
  `gi restore`. Mention them only as compact context when relevant, then ask for
  the user's current task instead of offering to continue, run, push, or finish
  them.
- Treat `gi init <source>`, `init <source>`, `инит <source>`, and
  `инициализируй <source>` that point to the canonical shared-instruction Git
  repository `https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`, the
  shorter GitHub repo form `Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`, the current
  shared-instruction checkout/cache, `GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_HOME`, or another
  known shared-instruction source as a shared-instruction bootstrap/startup
  request, even when the user supplies the source as a Markdown link.
  Read the repository's local instructions and follow the documented `gi`
  bootstrap rules. Do not reinterpret that form as Git initialization, OpenCode
  setup, project creation, or skill creation unless the user explicitly names
  that action.
  Treat `инит правила <source>` the same way when `<source>` points to
  `general-instructions`. Examples such as
  `инит <path-to-general-instructions>` and
  `инит правила <path-to-general-instructions>` mean "load or initialize
  instruction rules from the existing shared-instruction source"; they never
  mean `git init`. Do not create folders, initialize `.git`, or suggest
  `npm init` / `python -m venv` for this form.
- Treat screenshots, logs, pasted errors, or other bug evidence as requests for
  analysis first. Explain the likely issue and ask what action the user wants
  before editing files, unless the user explicitly says to fix it, such as
  `fix`, `почини`, or `gi почини`.
- When the user explicitly says to fix an issue, treat that as approval to take
  required low-risk implementation and verification actions without an extra
  confirmation prompt, including rebuilding, restarting the affected local
  process, or closing a currently running app window that blocks single-instance
  verification. Still ask before destructive actions, possible data loss,
  credential or secret handling, external system changes, or unrelated scope.
- When a user provides a PDF path or attachment and asks to inspect, verify, or
  reread it, read the actual PDF before relying on memory, chat fragments, or
  screenshots. First confirm the file exists and page count/metadata when cheap,
  then try local text extraction with available PDF tools or libraries. On this
  Windows setup, if plain `python` is blocked by user-profile AppData access,
  prefer `uv run --with pypdf python -c "..."` as a non-project fallback for
  extracting page text without changing repository dependencies. If extracted
  text is empty or clearly incomplete, treat the PDF as possibly scanned and
  ask before using OCR, network services, installing tools, or writing extracted
  content to the repository. Summarize only task-relevant findings and avoid
  printing full private documents by default.
- Ask before expanding into unrelated scope. Proceed without asking only when
  the expansion is required for the stated goal and remains low-risk.
- Before filesystem writes, verify that the active working directory, local
  project identity, and target path match the user's current request. Use local
  identity signals such as `AGENTS.md`, README title, package or app manifests,
  service id, git remote, project-memory orientation, and documented working
  areas. If those signals point to a different project than the request, or the
  request names a different product/repository while the active root is
  unchanged, stop and report the mismatch before editing. A path or product
  name from old chat, a screenshot, task-manager metadata, a summary, or a
  stale plan is not permission to edit that other project.
- When the current user message explicitly names an absolute path outside the
  active project root and an action, state the active root and the external
  target before acting. If the named path looks like another project root,
  proceed only when the user clearly asked to work in that external project for
  this task; otherwise ask one short confirmation question.
- When preparing a project for a repository, publishing to GitHub, or removing
  "unneeded" files, do not classify `AGENTS.md`, `tools/`,
  `tools/project-memory/`, `skills/`, bootstrap scripts, update scripts, deploy
  scripts, or agent-facing instruction/config files as removable only because
  they look internal or tool-related. Inspect their purpose first and treat them
  as possible RAG/startup infrastructure. Delete them only when the user
  explicitly confirms they are temporary or unrelated to the project.
- During repository cleanup, classify SQLite and database files before acting.
  Do not delete or commit `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3`, or `*.db` files solely
  because they are binary or local-looking. Keep generated agent-memory indexes
  such as `tools/project-memory/project_memory.sqlite` ignored when they are
  rebuildable, and commit the reviewable README, Markdown/JSON memory exports,
  schema, and indexing scripts instead. Do not commit databases containing
  secrets, private data, telemetry, task-manager state, absolute local paths, or
  agent conversation history.
- Treat this repository root as the filesystem boundary for normal work. Do not
  read, search, edit, create, delete, move, or inspect files in another project
  or arbitrary external folder unless the user gives an explicit concrete path
  and action. Communicate with other projects through documented APIs,
  connectors, or task-manager endpoints.
- Treat `.\others\` under the current workspace parent, or another
  project-local relative path named by local instructions, as the standard local
  parent folder for third-party projects, cloned external repositories, and
  vendor experiments when no more specific destination is provided. This default
  folder is configurable: if the user gives another path or project-local
  instructions define another third-party workspace parent, use that instead. Do
  not mix third-party projects into the current project workspace.
